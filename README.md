## 🏗️ Solution Architecture  

```
Blog.Solution/
├─ Blog.Api/             → API Layer (Controllers, DTOs, Mapping, Middleware, Swagger)
├─ Blog.Application/     → Application Layer (Services)
├─ Blog.Core/            → Domain Layer (Entities, Identity, Interfaces, Specifications)
├─ Blog.Infrastructure/  → Infrastructure Layer (EF Core, Repositories, Redis)
```


**Key Principles:**  
- Clean Architecture (Onion-style layering)  
- Dependency Injection across all layers  
- AutoMapper for DTO and entity mapping  
- Strict separation of persistence models from API contracts

## 📐 Patterns & Practices  
- **Repository Pattern** – clean abstraction for data access  
- **Unit of Work** – transaction management and consistency  
- **Specification Pattern** – flexible and reusable query logic  
- **DTOs & AutoMapper** – decoupled data transfer  
- **Distributed Caching (Redis)** – optimized performance and scalability  
- **SignalR** – enabling real-time features
